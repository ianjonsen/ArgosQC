Description: An automated Argos location quality control process for IMOS ATF Argos location data from SMRU CTD-SRDL tags. Functions automatically download and collate campaign-specific .mdb files from the SMRU server; matches deployments with user-supplied deployment metadata; projects location data to an Antarctic Stereographic projection; fits specified SSM's in 2 passes; collates results by species & campaign; generates diagnostic plots & maps; appends predicted locations to SMRU activity files (CTD, dive, haulout, summary, diag) at tag-measured event times; saves activity files as .csv in IMOS ATF schema; pushes QC'd files to AODN incoming server.
