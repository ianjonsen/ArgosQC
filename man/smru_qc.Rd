\usage{
smru_qc(wd, config)
}
\arguments{
\item{config}{a hierarchical JSON configuration file containing the following
blocks, each with a set of block-specific parameters:
\itemize{
\item \code{setup} config block specifies paths to required data, metadata & output
directories:
\itemize{
\item \code{data.dir} the name of the data directory. Must reside within the \code{wd}.
\item \code{meta.file} the metadata filename. Must reside within the \code{wd}. Can be NULL,
in which case, the \code{meta} config block (see below) must be present &
tag-specific metadata are scraped from the SMRU data server.
\item \code{maps.dir} the directory path to write diagnostic maps of QC'd tracks.
\item \code{diag.dir} the directory path to write diagnostic time-series plots of
QC'd lon & lat.
\item \code{output.dir} the directory path to write QC output CSV files. Must reside
within the \code{wd}.
\item \code{program} the national (or other) program of which the data is a part.
Current options are: \code{imos}, \code{atn}, or \code{otn}.
}
\item \code{harvest} config block specifies data harvesting parameters:
\itemize{
\item \code{download} a logical indicating whether tag data are to be downloaded from
the SMRU data server or read from the local \code{data.dir}.
\item \code{cid} SMRU campaign ID.
\item \code{smru.usr} SMRU data server username as a string.
\item \code{smru.pwd} SMRU data server password as a string.
\item \code{timeout} extends the download timeout period a specified number of
seconds for slower internet connections.
\item \code{dropIDs} the SMRU ref ID's that are to be ignored during the QC process.
Can be NULL.
\item \code{p2mdbtools} (optional) provides the path to the mdbtools library if it
is installed in a non-standard location (e.g., on Macs when installed via
Homebrew).
}
\item \code{model} config block specifies model- and data-specific parameters:
\itemize{
\item \code{model} the aniMotum SSM model to be used for the location QC - typically
either \code{rw} or \code{crw}.
\item \code{vmax} for SSM fitting; max travel rate (m/s) to identify implausible
locations
\item \code{time.step} the prediction interval (in decimal hours) to be used by the
SSM
\item \code{proj} the proj4string to be used for the location data & for the
SSM-estimated locations. Can be NULL, which will result in one of 5
projections being used, depending on whether the centroid of the observed
latitudes lies in N or S polar regions, temperate or equatorial regions, or
if tracks straddle (or lie close to) -180,180 longitude.
\item \code{reroute} a logical; whether QC'd tracks should be re-routed off of land
(default is FALSE). Note, in some circumstances this can substantially
increase processing time. Default land polygon data are sourced from the
\code{ropensci/rnaturalearthhires} R package.
\item \code{dist} the distance in km from outside the convex hull of observed
locations from which to select land polygon data for re-routing. Ignored
if \code{reroute = FALSE}.
\item \code{buffer} the distance in km to buffer rerouted locations from the
coastline. Ignored if \code{reroute = FALSE}.
\item \code{centroids} whether centroids are to be included in the visibility graph
mesh used by the rerouting algorithm. See \code{?pathroutr::prt_visgraph} for
details. Ignored if \code{reroute = FALSE}.
\item \code{cut} logical; should predicted locations be dropped if they lie within
in a large data gap (default is FALSE).
\item \code{min.gap} the minimum data gap duration (h) to be used for cutting
predicted locations (default is 72 h)
\item \code{QCmode} one of either \code{nrt} for Near Real-Time QC or \code{dm} for Delayed
Mode QC.
}
\item \code{meta} config block specifies species and deployment location information.
This config block is only necessary when no metadata file is provided in the
\code{setup} config block.
\itemize{
\item \code{common_name} the species common name (e.g., "southern elephant seal")
\item \code{species} the species scientific name (e.g., "Mirounga leonina")
\item \code{release_site} the location where tags were deployed (e.g., "Iles Kerguelen")
\item \code{state_country} the country/territory name (e.g., "French Overseas Territory")
}
\item \code{output} logical; should the function return a list of QC-generated objects.
This results in a single large object returned to the R work space containing
the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{cid} the SMRU campaign ID
\item \code{dropIDs} the SMRU Reference ID's droppped from the QC process
\item \code{smru} the SMRU tag data tables extracted from the downloaded .mdb file
\item \code{meta} the working metadata
\item \code{locs_sf} the projected location data to be passed as input to the SSM
\item \code{fit1} the initial SSM output fit object
\item \code{fit2} the final SSM output fit object including re-routed locations if
specified.
\item \code{smru_ssm} the SSM-annotated SMRU tag data tables.
This output object can be useful for troubleshooting undesirable results
during supervised or delayed-mode QC workflows.
}
}}

\item{`wd`}{the path to the working directory that contains: 1) the data directory
where tag data files are stored (if \code{harvest$download} = FALSE) or downloaded to
(if \code{harvest$download} = TRUE); 2) the metadata directory where all metadata
files are stored; and 3) the destination directory for QC outputs.}
}
\description{
Wrapper function that executes the complete SMRU QC workflow from data
download to SSM-appended tag data files output as CSV files. All settings are
specified in a JSON config file, including program - currently, IMOS, ATN or OTN.
The program field determines the specific ArgosQC workflow functions called
within the wrapper fn.
