\arguments{
\item{smru_ssm}{SSM-appended SMRU table file - output of \code{append_ssm}}

\item{fit}{final \code{aniMotum} fit object}

\item{what}{specify whether predicted or rerouted locations are to be used}

\item{meta}{metadata}

\item{program}{Determines structure of output metadata. Currently, either `imos` or `atn`.}

\item{test}{should variables be tested for standards compliance, default is TRUE.
