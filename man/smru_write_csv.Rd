  program = "imos",
  test = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{smru_ssm}{SSM-appended SMRU table file - output of \code{append_ssm}}

\item{fit}{final \code{aniMotum} fit object}

\item{what}{specify whether predicted or rerouted locations are to be used}

\item{meta}{metadata}

\item{program}{Determines structure of output metadata. The \code{imos} & \code{atn} programs
have their own defined metadata structures, all other programs are treated as "Generic".}

\item{test}{should variables be tested for standards compliance, default is TRUE.
Standards compliance is specific to the program. Currently, only program = \code{imos}
has defined variable standard against which output compliance is tested.}

\item{path}{path to write .csv files}

\item{dropIDs}{individual SMRU ids to be dropped}

\item{suffix}{suffix to add to .csv files (_nrt, _dm, or _hist)}
}
