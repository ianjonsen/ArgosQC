## Background
`ArgosQC` provides automated workflows for quality controlling Argos & GPS (when present) locations obtained from either SMRU SRDL or Wildlife Computers animal telemetry tags. Workflows currently are set up for IMOS and ATN tagging data. The general workflow for SMRU tags is documented in [Jonsen et al. 2024](https://repository.oceanbestpractices.org/handle/11329/2571). The workflow for Wildlife Computers tags is analogous but not identical due to differences in both the structure and nature of the data the tags collect and transmit.

## Workflows
Several automated QC workflows have been set up for SMRU SRDL-CTD (and related) tags, and for Wildlife Computers SPOT, SPLASH and SCOUT tags. The workflows are specific to IMOS - AODN and ATN metadata and QC output data structure requirements. The following QC workflows can be implement from a single `ArgosQC` function & a required config JSON file, with output written to .CSV files in a user-specified directory:

|             Workflow                                   |    Function         |
|:------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------:|
| SMRU SRDL-CTD (and related) tags +  IMOS metadata      |  `smru_qc()`   |
| SMRU SRDL-CTD (and related) tags + ATN metadata        |  `smru_qc()`    |
| Wildlife Computers SPOT, SPLASH, and SCOUT tags + ATN metadata   |  `wc_qc()`      |
| Wildlife Computers tag data + Generic metadata         |  `wc_qc()`      |


These single function workflows simplify the automated QC implementation. Additional workflows will be added as required to accommodate additional tag manufacturers and/or tag data structures, as well as organisational metadata and output data formatting requirements. The QC workflows can also be implemented by calling individual `ArgosQC` functions in series as required. This latter approach allows greater flexibility as intermediate & final output data and metadata can be re-structured as needed. The single function SMRU tag QC & ATN Wildlife Computers tag workflows are highlighted below.

## Example

## 1. SMRU SRDL-CTD tag data QC workflow
The first step to initiate any ArgosQC workflow is to construct a JSON config file. The file is hierarchical in structure with as many as 4 blocks: `setup`, `harvest`, `model`, and `meta`. The `meta` block is only required if no metadata file is provided in the `setup` block. These files can be constructed manually or programmatically and provide the ability to define certain aspects of the QC workflow. Below is the config file for an IMOS QC workflow on SMRU GPS SRDL-CTD tags deployed on olive ridley turtles on the Tiwi Islands, Australia. All SMRU tag data are organised by deployment campaign ids, e.g., `ct188`. A separate QC workflow (config file) must be generated for each deployment campaign.

<center>
![](images/IMOS_config_JSON.png){width=100%}
</center>
The block-specific parameters are as follows:
<ul>
 <li> `setup` config block specifies the program overseeing data assembly & paths 
 to required data, metadata & output directories:
    <ul>
    <li> `program` the national (or other) program of which the data is a part.
    Current options are: `imos`, `atn`, or `otn`.
    <li> `data.dir` the name of the data directory. Must reside within the `wd`.
    <li> `meta.file` the metadata filename. Must reside within the `wd`. Can be NULL,
    in which case, the `meta` config block (see below) must be present & 
    tag-specific metadata are scraped from the SMRU data server.
    <li> `maps.dir` the directory path to write diagnostic maps of QC'd tracks.
    <li> `diag.dir` the directory path to write diagnostic time-series plots of
    QC'd lon & lat.
    <li> `output.dir` the directory path to write QC output CSV files. Must reside
    within the `wd`.
    <li> `return.R` a logical indicating whether the function should return a list 
    of QC-generated, internal R objects. This results in a single large object 
    returned to the R work space containing the following elements:
      <ul>
      <li> `cid` the SMRU campaign ID
      <li> `dropIDs` the SMRU Reference ID's dropped from the QC process
      <li> `smru` the SMRU tag data tables extracted from the downloaded .mdb file
      <li> `meta` the working metadata
      <li> `locs_sf` the projected location data to be passed as input to the SSM
      <li> `fit1` the initial SSM output fit object
      <li> `fit2` the final SSM output fit object including re-routed locations if
      specified.
      <li> `smru_ssm` the SSM-annotated SMRU tag data tables. This output object
      can be useful for troubleshooting undesirable results during delayed-mode 
      (supervised) QC workflows.  
</ul></ul></ul>

  
<ul>   
 <li> `harvest` config block specifies data harvesting parameters:
    <ul>
    <li> `download` a logical indicating whether tag data are to be downloaded from
    the SMRU data server or read from the local `data.dir`.
    <li> `cid` SMRU campaign ID.
    <li> `smru.usr` SMRU data server username as a string.
    <li> `smru.pwd` SMRU data server password as a string.
    <li> `timeout` extends the download timeout period a specified number of
    seconds for slower internet connections.
    <li> `dropIDs` the SMRU ref ID's that are to be ignored during the QC process.
    Can be NULL.
    <li> `p2mdbtools` (optional) provides the path to the mdbtools library (required 
    extract data from `.mdb` -Microsoft Access Database files) if it
    is installed in a non-standard location (e.g., on Macs when installed via
    Homebrew). Can be set to NULL otherwise.  
 </ul></ul></ul>     
    
<ul>  
 <li> `model` config block specifies model- and data-specific parameters:
  <ul>
   <li> `model` the aniMotum SSM model to be used for the location QC - typically
 either `rw` or `crw`.
   <li> `vmax` for SSM fitting; max travel rate (m/s) to identify implausible
   locations
   <li> `time.step` the prediction interval (in decimal hours) to be used by the
   SSM
   <li> `proj` the proj4string to be used for the location data & for the
   SSM-estimated locations. Can be NULL, which will result in one of 5
   projections being used, depending on whether the centroid of the observed
   latitudes lies in N or S polar regions, temperate or equatorial regions, or
   if tracks straddle (or lie close to) -180,180 longitude.
   <li> `reroute` a logical; whether QC'd tracks should be re-routed off of land
   (default is FALSE). Note, in some circumstances this can substantially
   increase processing time. Default land polygon data are sourced from the
   `ropensci/rnaturalearthhires` R package.
   <li> `dist` the distance in km from outside the convex hull of observed
   locations from which to select land polygon data for re-routing. Ignored
   if `reroute = FALSE`.
   <li> `barrier` an optional filepath to an alternate polygon data file for the 
   land (or other) barrier. For example, higher resolution local coastline data
   can be supplied, provided the data extend at least `dist` km beyond the 
   extent of the track data.
   <li> `buffer` the distance in km to buffer rerouted locations from the
   coastline. Ignored if `reroute = FALSE`.
   <li> `centroids` whether centroids are to be included in the visibility graph
   mesh used by the rerouting algorithm. See `?pathroutr::prt_visgraph` for
   details. Ignored if `reroute = FALSE`.
   <li> `cut` logical; should predicted locations be dropped if they lie within
   in a large data gap (default is FALSE).
   <li> `min.gap` the minimum data gap duration (h) to be used for cutting
   predicted locations (default is 72 h)
   <li> `QCmode` one of either `nrt` for Near Real-Time QC or `dm` for Delayed
   Mode QC.
</ul></ul>

<ul>
  <li> `meta` config block specifies species and deployment location information.
 This config block is only necessary when no metadata file is provided in the
 `setup` block.
  <ul>
   <li> `common_name` the species common name (e.g., "southern elephant seal")
   <li> `species` the species scientific name (e.g., "Mirounga leonina")
   <li> `release_site` the location where tags were deployed (e.g., "Iles Kerguelen")
   <li> `state_country` the country/territory name (e.g., "French Overseas Territory")
</ul></ul>


With a completed config file, the standard call within R is:
```{r fn call, eval=FALSE}
smru_qc(wd = "test", config = "imos_config.json")
```
where `wd` is the file path for the working directory within which all QC data/metadata inputs are downloaded (or read) and outputs are written.


### Additional details on config parameters
The `proj` argument specifies the projection (as a `proj4string`) to which the tag-measured locations are converted as input to the QC state-space model (SSM), ie. the working projection in `km` for the SSM. Any valid `proj4string` may be used, provided the units are in `km`. If `proj` is left as `NULL` then the QC algorithm will project the data differently depending on the centroid latitude of the tracks. The default projections are:

|         Central Latitude or Longitude       |                           Projection (with `+units=km`)                                                        |
|:------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|     -55 to -25 or 25 to 55 Lat |  Equidistant Conic with standard parallels at the tracks' 25th & 75 percentile Latitudes    |
|     < -55 or > 55 Lat  |   Stereographic with origin at the tracks' centroid         |
|     -25 to 25 Lat             |            Mercator with origin at the tracks' centroid              |
|    -25 to 25 Lat & Long straddles -180,180      |   Longitudes are shifted to 0, 360 and a Mercator with origin at tracks' centroid   |


The `model` argument specifies the `aniMotum` SSM to be used; typically either `rw` or `crw`. The latter is usually less biased when data gaps are absent, the former is best when data gaps are present. A general recommendation is to use `model`:`rw` as the SSM for unsupervised (e.g., NRT) QC workflows. The SSM fitting algorithm has a few fundamental parameters that need to be specified; `vmax` is the animals' maximum plausible travel rate in ms$^{-1}$. For example, `vmax`:`3` is usually appropriate for seals and `vmax`:`2` for turtles. The SSM prediction interval in hours is specified with `time.step`. Decimal hours can be used for `time.steps` shorter than 1 hr. This time interval determines the temporal resolution of the predicted track. The predicted track locations provide the basis for interpolation to the time of each tag-measured ocean observation or behavioural event. Typically, 6 hours is appropriate for most Argos data collected from seals and turtles but a finer time interval may be required for faster moving species and/or more frequently measured ocean observations, and a coarser interval for more sporadically observed locations. Further details on SSM fitting to Argos and GPS data are provided in the associated R package [aniMotum vignettes](https://ianjonsen.github.io/aniMotum/) and in [Jonsen et al. 2023](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.14060).

When animals pass close to land some SSM-predicted locations may implausibly lie on land. Often, this is due to the spatial and temporal resolution of the Argos tracking data. In these cases, SSM-predicted locations can be adjusted minimally off of land by setting `reroute`:`true`. The [`pathroutr` R package](https://jmlondon.github.io/pathroutr/) is used for efficient rerouting. In this case, additional arguments should be specified:

`dist` - the distance in km beyond track locations from which coastline polygon data should be sampled (smaller provides less information for path re-routing, greater increase computation time)

`buffer` - the distance in km to buffer rerouted locations from the coastline

`centroid`- whether to include the visibility graph centroids for greater resolution

SSM-predicted tracks can be `cut` (`cut`:`true`) in regions where large location data gaps exist. These location data gaps can occur when the tags are unable to transmit for extended periods or when animal surfacing occurs during periods of Argos satellite unavailability (more common closer to the equator than at higher latitudes). In this case, `min.gap` is used to specify the minimum data gap duration (h) from which to cut SSM-predicted locations. This will limit interpolation artefacts due to implausible SSM-predicted locations in excessively long data gap periods. 

The `QCmode` sets whether the QC is being conducted in delayed-mode `dm` or near real-time `nrt`. Delayed-mode is reserved for when tag deployments have ended and usually involve greater user intervention; such as making decisions on removing aberrant portions of a deployment (e.g., as tag batteries begin failing). The `nrt` mode is mean to be fully automated and only used while a deployment is active. In both cases, the output .CSV and plot file names will include the `QCmode` as a suffix.


In the above example, the main QC outputs were written to files. The QC output .CSV files were written to the specified output directory. Each .CSV file includes the name of the SMRU data table, when present (ctd, diag, dive, haulout, summary) or the QC file (metadata, ssmoutputs). For QC workflows of ATN data, each of these file names is appended with the species' AnimalAphiaID and the ADRProjectID. For IMOS and other program data, the file names are appended with the SMRU campaign ID.

The diag files show the SSM fit (red) overlaid on the tag-measured Argos &/or GPS locations (blue). The dark grey vertical bars denote the time period tags were actively recording locations but the seal(s) had not yet gone to sea (no recorded diving activity). By default, the QC model does not fit to data in these time periods. These plots help judge whether the SSM fits have artefacts that need addressing - typically only addressed during a delayed-mode QC workflow.

The map file shows the SSM-predicted tracks (blue) and current last estimated location (red) for each deployed tag. The map files are annotated by the QC date so they are not overwritten by successive QC runs.

#### Output .CSV files

The QC's main outputs, the .CSV files contain all records from the original SMRU data tables and are appended with the following additional columns: `ssm_lat`, `ssm_lon`, `ssm_x`, `ssm_y`, `ssm_x_se`, `ssm_y_se`. These are the QC'd locations and their uncertainty estimates interpolated to the time of each record. The `ssm_x`, `ssm_y` variables are the coordinates from the QC workflow projection (in km) and `ssm_x_se`, `ssm_y_se` are the associated standard errors (in km). Note that NA's may be present in the QC-appended location variables, particularly at the start and/or end of individual tracks. This is typically indicative of track portions prior to animals going to sea (at deployment start) and portions when either the CTD or pressure sensor failed, eg. due to biofouling or seawater ingress, but tag still transmitted locations (near deployment end).

#### Metadata .CSV file
If an input deployment/tag metadata file is provided then the output metadata file contains all the original metadata records plus the following variables describing the QC workflow applied to the data:

- `QCStartDateTime` - the track datetime (UTC) at which the QC workflow was started.
- `QCStopDateTime` - the track datetime (UTC) at which the QC workflow was ended.
- `QCproj4string` - the projection used for QC'ing the locations, as a proj4string.
- `QCMethod` - denotes the `ArgosQC` R package was used.
- `QCVersion` - denotes the version number of the `ArgosQC` R package used.
- `QCDateTime` - the datetime (UTC) when the QC was applied to the data.

Note, these variables are not appended to the metadata for IMOS QC workflows due to IMOS - AODN metadata specifications.

#### SSMOutputs .CSV file
The SSMOutputs file contains the SSM-predicted locations at the `time.step` specified prediction interval. The time of the first location is set to the time of the first tag-measured location passed to the model. This may or may not be the first tag-measured location in the tag datafile, depending on whether the animal-borne tag was immediately at sea. The location coordinates are provided as: `lon`, `lat`, `x`, `y`, and location uncertainty as `x_se`, `y_se`. The planar coordinates and uncertainty estimates always have units in km. Their coordinate projection is provided in the metadata .CSV file (`QCproj4string`).

## 2. Wildlife Computers (WC) tag data QC workflow
The Wildlife Computers JSON config file has the same 4-block structure as the SMRU config file (`meta` block is optional), however, some of the parameters within the blocks differ. Below is the config file for a NSWOO (IRAP) QC workflow on WC SPOT tags deployed on green turtles in NSW, Australia.

<center>
![](images/IRAP_config_JSON.png){width=70%}
The call within R is
```{r fn2 call, eval=FALSE}
wc_qc(wd = "test", config = "irap_config.json")
```

The arguments are similar to `atn_smru_qc()`, with the addition of Wildlife Computers API identifiers: `collab.id`, `wc.akey`, and `wc.skey`. These may be used to download data directly from the Wildlife Computers Portal, in this case, data are written to tag-specific directories within the specified `datadir` directory. The `collab.id` argument specifies the Wildlife Computers collaborator ID, which is required if the user does not own or otherwise does not have direct access to the data. Note, that data-sharing collaborations must be set up in the Wildlife Computers Portal prior to using this tool. `ArgosQC` who are Wildlife Computers data owners may access their data from the Portal simply by providing the `wc.akey` and `wc.skey` arguments. The `wc.akey` specifies the Wildlife Computers Access Key that all Portal users must have to access the API. The Access key is used in tandem with the `wc.skey`, the Wildlife Computers Secret Key. No data downloads from the Wildlife Computers Portal are possible without these key pairs. 

Alternatively, `atn_wc_qc()` may be used with local copies of Wildlife Computers tag data, provided they are stored in tag-specific directories within the `datadir` directory.

#### Output .CSV files
The QC's main outputs are the Wildlife Computers tag data files appended with the same QC'd location variables as the SMRU tag QC output files: `ssm_lat`, `ssm_lon`, `ssm_x`, `ssm_y`, `ssm_x_se`, `ssm_y_se`. The output .CSV files necessarily depend on the specific type of Wildlife Computers tag(s) that is/are being QC'd. Currently, the `ArgosQC` workflow accommodates SPOT, SPLASH and SCOUT tag data. Combined across these tag types, the following output .CSV files (per Wildlife Computers) are provided:

- `DSA`
- `ECDHistos`
- `FastGPS`
- `Histos`
- `Locations`
- `MinMaxDepth`
- `MixLayer`
- `PDTs`
- `SST`

Where one of these files can have a data structure that differs between specific tag types, the file names are appended with the tag type. For example, `ECDHistos` file structure differ between SCOUT DSA and SCOUT TEMP 361A tags, so these file names appear as either `ECDHistos_SCOUT_DSA` or `ECDHistos_SCOUT_TEMP_361A`. Similar scenarios for other tag types/versions will be incorporated as required in future versions of `ArgosQC`.

As with the SMRU QC output files, each of the WC QC output file names are appended with the species' AnimalAphiaID, the ATN ADRProjectID and the `QCmode` suffix - `_nrt` or `_dm`. The metadata structure and appended QC variables are the same as described for the SMRU QC workflow.
